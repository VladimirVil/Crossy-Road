# Crossy Road

The aim of the game is to stay alive and collect as much coins as possible. When the
player is hit by vehicles(bunch of different cars, trains) he dies. The player can travel on the wood log.
The game world is limited*

For the movement the player should use the arrows. Player implementation based
on LeanTween engine. Simple animations implemented for player and coins. Camera 
shaked added for enhanced experience(when player is hit). Camera 
implemented separately and not as player's child


*As a feature, all the steps towards forward are counted and the world expands in this 
direction with every step .
